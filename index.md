I am currently a PhD candidate at McGill University working with Prof. Ken Ragan. I work on particle astrophysics with the [VERITAS telescopes](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/). 

My work focuses on studying TeV emission from Galactic sources to search for PeVatrons (PeV cosmic-ray-producing sources), very high energy pulsed emission from pulsars, and understanding the nature of extended emission from unassociated sources. I work with [_Gammapy_](https://gammapy.org/), an open-source gamma-ray analysis package and have created a [tutorial](https://docs.gammapy.org/2.0.1/tutorials/data/veritas.html) for working with open VERITAS data. 

I'm also an author for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/) a reader's digest that publishes accessible paper summaries for recent results in astrophysics (read my bites [here](https://astrobites.org/author/swong/)). I'm the current observatory coordinator at McGill University's [Anna McPherson Observatory](https://tsi.mcgill.ca/index.php?page=observing), where I lead monthly public observing nights (see the TSI McGill instagram for our future events). I've also contributed to the McGill physics [_Bringing Contemporary Physicists to the Classroom_](https://classroom-physicists.physics.mcgill.ca/) website, which matches undergraduate curricula to contemporary and representative physics to give students real examples of physics applications and the people behind them.
